# Power Policy (PowerDMS Policy)

Power Policy is a cloud-based policy and compliance management system designed to centralize and control an organization’s policies, procedures, and related documents — ensuring employees see the correct version, understand it, and are held accountable for it. It’s widely used in highly regulated environments like public safety, healthcare, and enterprise compliance.

## 1. Central Repository & Content Support

**Single Source of Truth**

Stores all organizational policies, procedures, manuals, and related compliance content in one secure, cloud-based system.

**Content Types Supported**

Documents (Word, Excel, PDFs)
PowerPoint
Images, audio, video
Spreadsheets and specialized files — all searchable and linked to workflow and compliance tracking.

This eliminates paper binders, disparate file shares, and email distribution — ensuring consistent access to the right information at all times.

## 2. Version Control & Document History

Fundamental MVP capability: track every revision of every policy so that users are always looking at the latest approved version, with full history retained.

**Key Version Control Features**

One published version of each policy at a time.
Archived prior versions kept for audit, reference, and compliance without cluttering user access.
Audit history includes:
* Edit logs
* Review comments
* Approvals
* Signature/attestation history
Optional side-by-side version comparison to highlight changes between revisions.

This version control eliminates confusion from multiple copies and ensures a single canonical policy source.

## 3. Workflow & Review Approvals

Power Policy integrates workflows so policies move through structured creation, review, and approval steps:

* Assign reviewers, approvers, and editors
* Build reusable workflow templates
* Track real-time progress through each review stage
* Optionally give ad-hoc editing rights to specific users
* Automated notifications when steps are due or completed

This lets organizations enforce consistent policy review cycles and approval hierarchies.

## 4. Attestations & Electronic Signatures

A critical compliance feature is to ensure individuals acknowledge and accept responsibility for reviewing relevant policy updates.

**How Attestation Works**

Users are assigned policy review tasks
They log in, open the document, then click to attest (“sign”) using:
* Username/password
* Biometric sign-off (e.g., thumbprint in mobile app)

This places a verifiable electronic signature on the policy record.

**Why It Matters**

* Demonstrates that employees read and acknowledged policy changes
* Provides evidence for compliance, regulatory, and legal validation
* Reduces liability and claims of ignorance or “I didn’t see it”

Organizations can also track who hasn’t signed yet, sending reminders and enforcing deadlines.

## 5. Access Control & Search

**Controlled Access**

Define roles, groups, and individual permissions:
* View-only
* Audit/reporting
* Edit
* Administrative rights

**Robust Search**

* Full-text searchable repository
* Folder hierarchy, tags, bookmarks to quickly locate relevant policies

This ensures only authorized users see the right content and that no outdated policy is mistakenly used.

## 6. Mobile Access & Notifications

Employees can access policies and attest on mobile devices, including smartphones and tablets.

**Mobile Capabilities**

* View & search policies
* Electronic signatures
* Real-time push notifications for assigned policy tasks

This broadens accessibility, especially for field staff or distributed teams.

## 7. Compliance Tracking & Reporting

Beyond distribution and sign-off, Power Policy tracks compliance metrics:

**Who has/hasn’t:**

* Opened a policy
* Signed it
* Completed linked tests or training

**Audit trails that tie policy versions to:**

* Edit history
* Approvals
* Attestations
* Workflow steps

Dashboards and status views help supervisors monitor compliance and prepare for external audits or accreditation.

## 8. Integration with Training & Accreditation (Platform Context)

While Power Policy itself focuses on policy lifecycle and attestations, it’s part of the larger PowerDMS platform that can tie policies to:

* Online training courses
* Tests linked to policy comprehension
* Accreditation standards and evidence mapping
* Training records and certificates

In this extended setup, a policy update can automatically trigger updates to associated training, and training results help demonstrate compliance for external standards.

## Minimum Viable Product Summary

In MVP terms, Power Policy delivers:

* Central policy repository
* Version control + history
* Structured workflows & approvals
* Electronic attestations with signature capture
* Access control & robust search
* Mobile access & notifications
* Compliance dashboards & audit trails
* Optional linkage to training/accreditation when installed as part of the broader PowerDMS platform
